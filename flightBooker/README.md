> The task is to build a frame containing a combobox *C* with the two options “one-way flight” and “return flight”, two textfields *T<sub>1</sub>* and *T<sub>2</sub>* representing the start and return date, respectively, and a button *B* for “submitting” the selected flight. *T<sub>2</sub>* is enabled iff *C*'s value is “return flight”. When *C* has the value “return flight” and *T<sub>2</sub>*'s date is strictly before *T<sub>1</sub>*'s then *B* is disabled. When a non-disabled textfield *T* has an ill-formatted date then *T* is colored red and *B* is disabled. When clicking *B* a message is displayed informing the user of his selection (e.g. “You have booked a one-way flight on 04.04.2014.”). Initially, *C* has the value “one-way flight” and *T<sub>1</sub>* as well as *T<sub>2</sub>* have the same (arbitrary) date (it is implied that *T<sub>2</sub>* is disabled).

> The focus of Flight Booker lies on modelling constraints between widgets on the one hand and modelling constraints within a widget on the other hand. Such constraints are very common in everyday interactions with GUI applications. A good solution for Flight Booker will make the constraints clear, succinct and explicit in the source code and not hidden behind a lot of scaffolding.

> Flight Booker is directly inspired by the [Flight Booking Java example in Sodium](http://blog.reactiveprogramming.org/?p=21) with the simplification of having textfields for date input instead of specialized date picking widgets as the focus of Flight Booker is not on specialized/custom widgets.
